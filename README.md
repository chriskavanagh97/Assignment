# Three-point estimation

After splitting the tasks into sub tasks, you now must ask the team or person responsible for each sub task to provide a three-point estimation.

A three point-task estimation is the simple practice of estimating the worse, best and most realistic outcomes of tasks regarding time consumption.

* **B** = Best case estimate, the case where everything works perfect
* **W** = worse case estimate, the case where everything seems to go wrong
* **M** = Most realistic estimate, the most realistic estimate based on experience.


Now after calculating these three values we will put them into the formula below:

**Task Duration** == *(B + W +(4 * M)) / 6*

__Letâ€™s show an example:__

* B = 4, 
* W = 12, 
* M = 6 

So, the task duration is calculated as:

(4 +12 + 14)/6 = 7. **(** *All Numbers should be rounded to the nearest integer* **)**

Use three-point estimation for each task in your schedule, it will ensure that your task estimation is completed to the highest of standards.
